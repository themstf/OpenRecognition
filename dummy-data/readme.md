this is for developing the frontend

you can write JSON files of dummy data that match your schemas and call on these files while developing your frontend.  doing this allows the frontend and the backend to develop at their own pace

when writing your dummy can put in whatever you want for __v & _id so long as they're there, mongo will set those values.  you'll need to think about all the other keys and values.
